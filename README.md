# COVID-ODE-IVP-Model
A COVID Model that uses MATLAB parallel processing and Ordinary Differential Equations alongside a Genetic Algorithm to Model COVID using Certain Parameters.
Coded in MATLAB, this model uses the formulae stated in the paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12020.pdf] to model the spread of COVID using different parameters. It uses a 4th or 6th Order Runge-Kutta Integration Algrotihm to Solve the ODE-IVPs. To fine tune the model, a Genetic Algorithm with elitist Selection has been used. Government Stringency can also be entered in Time Series to be used as a parameter.
